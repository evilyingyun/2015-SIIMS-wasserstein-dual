Functional data analysis involves infinite dimensional processes and/or data. The paper shows how the theory of L-splines can support generalizations of linear modelling and principal components analysis to samples drawn from random functions. Spline smoothing rests on a partition of a function space into two orthogonal subspaces, one of which contains the obvious or structural components of variation among a set of observed functions, and the other of which contains residual components. This partitioning is achieved through the use of a linear differential operator, and we show how the theory of polynomial splines can be applied more generally with an arbitrary operator and associated boundary constraints. These data analysis tools are illustrated by a study of variation in temperature-precipitation patterns among some Canadian weather-stations.},

The authors notice that the entropy is usually underestimated, and that known correction for this bias depend strongly on correct knowledge of the studied distribution, thus they are mostly useless. A review of various coding (compression) algorithms is provided. Bayesian priors of the type Q^a are discussed and a=-1+1/K are hypothesised to be the best. Unfortunately, when it comes to numerical analysis, the authors only present pictures, but show no data and no details of the fits to see the fits' quality. Even worse, the authors never say which if the many methods to estimate entropies that they have discusses they actually used in their numerics.},

	Abstract = {{We address the problem of learning a symmetric positive definite
	matrix. The central issue is to design parameter updates that preserve
	positive definiteness. Our updates are motivated with the {\it von
	Neumann} divergence. Rather than treating the most general case,
	we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: on-line
	learning with a simple square loss, and finding a symmetric positive
	definite matrix subject to linear constraints. The updates generalize
	the exponentiated gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively:
	the parameter is now a symmetric positive definite matrix of trace
	one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal
	positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates
	use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive definiteness.
	Most importantly, we show how the derivation and the analyses of
	the original EG update and AdaBoost generalize to the non-diagonal
	case. We apply the resulting {\it matrix exponentiated gradient}
	(MEG) update and {\it DefiniteBoost} to the problem of learning a
	kernel matrix from distance measurements.}},

The priors assumed for the nonnull hypothesis are linear combinations of symmetric Dirichlet distributions as in some work of 1965 and later. The results can be used also for probability estimation. The evidence concerning independence, provided by the marginal totals alone, is evaluated, and preliminary numerical calculations suggest it is small. The possibility of applying the Bayes/non-Bayes synthesis is proposed because it was found useful for an analogous problem for multinomial distributions. As a spinoff, approximate formulae are suggested for enumerating "arrays" in two and more dimensions.},

	Abstract = {Detection of anomalies in multivariate time series is an
                   important data mining task with potential applications in
                   medical diagnosis, ecosystem modeling, and network traffic
                   monitoring. In this paper, we present a robust graph-based
                   algorithm for detecting anomalies in noisy multivariate time
                   series data. A key feature of the algorithm is the alignment
                   of kernel matrices constructed from the time series. The
                   aligned kernel enables the algorithm to capture the
                   dependence relationship between different time series and to
                   support the discovery of different types of anomalies
                   (including subsequence-based and local anomalies). We have
                   performed extensive experiments to demonstrate the
                   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We also present a
                   case study that shows the utility of applying our algorithm
                   to detect ecosystem disturbances in Earth science data.

	Abstract = {As the number of complete genomes rapidly
     increases, accurate methods to automatically predict the subcellular
     location of proteins are increasingly useful to help their functional
     annotation. {I}n order to improve the predictive accuracy of the
     many prediction methods developed to date, a novel representation
     of protein sequences is proposed. {T}his representation involves
     local compositions of amino acids and twin amino acids, and local
     frequencies of distance between successive (basic, hydrophobic, and other)
     amino acids. {F}or calculating the local features, each sequence is
     split into three parts: {N}-terminal, middle, and {C}-terminal. {T}he
     {N}-terminal part is further divided into four regions to consider ambiguity
     in the length and position of signal sequences. {W}e tested this
     representation with support vector machines on two data sets extracted from
     the {SWISS}-{PROT} database. {T}hrough fivefold cross-validation
     tests, overall accuracies of more than 87% and 91% were obtained for
     eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, respectively. {I}t is concluded that
     considering the respective features in the {N}-terminal, middle, and
     {C}-terminal parts is helpful to predict the subcellular location.},

@inproceedings{rakoto2007,
	Abstract = {An efficient and general multiple kernel learning
                   (MKL) algorithm has been recently proposed by
                   \singleemcite{sonnenburg_mkljmlr}. This approach has
                   opened new perspectives since it makes the MKL approach
                   tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively
                   using existing support vector machine code. However, it
                   turns out that this iterative algorithm needs several
                   iterations before converging towards a reasonable
                   solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem
                   through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation.
                   Weights on each kernel matrix are included in the
                   standard SVM empirical risk minimization problem with a
                   $\ell_1$ constraint to encourage sparsity. We propose
                   an algorithm for solving this problem and provide an
                   new insight on MKL algorithms based on block 1-norm
                   regularization by showing that the two approaches are
                   equivalent. Experimental results show that the
                   resulting algorithm converges rapidly and its
                   efficiency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Positive definite kernels between labeled graphs have
     recently been proposed.They enable the application of kernel methods,
     such as support vectormachines, to the analysis and classification
     of graphs, for example, chemicalcompounds. These graph kernels are
     obtained by marginalizing a kernel betweenpaths with respect to a
     random walk model on the graph vertices along theedges. We propose two
     extensions of these graph kernels, with the double goal toreduce their
     computation time and increase their relevance as measure ofsimilarity
     between graphs. First, we propose to modify the label of eachvertex
     by automatically adding information about its environment with the
     useof the Morgan algorithm. Second, we suggest a modification of the
     random walkmodel to prevent the walk from coming back to a vertex
     that was just visited.These extensions are then tested on benchmark
     experiments of chemicalcompounds classification, with promising results.},

	Abstract = {
We propose a new system for predicting the splice form of
Caenorhabditis elegans genes. As a first step we generate a clean
set of genes from available exressed sequence tags (EST) and
complete complementary (cDNA) sequences. From all such genes we then
generate potential acceptor and donor sites as they would be
required by any gene finder. This leads to a clean set of true and
decoy splice sites. In a second step we use support vector machines
(SVMs) with appropriately designed kernels to learn to distinguish
between true and decoy sites. Using the newly generated data and the
novel kernels we could considerably improve our previous results on
the same task.
   In the last step we design and test a new splice finder system that combines the
SVM predictions with additional statistical information about
splicing. Using this system we are able to predict the exon-intron
structure of a given gene with known translation initiation and stop
co don site. The system has been tested successfully on a newly
generated set of genes and compared with GenScan. We found that our
system predicts the correct splice form for more than 92\% of these
genes, whereas GenScan only achieves 77.5\% accuracy.},

classification tasks, because of the high dimensionality of the

kernels of the form $K(mathbf{x},mathbf{y})=e^{-rhosum_i
|x_i^a-y_i^a|^{b}}$ with $aleq 1$ and $b leq 2$ are evaluated on the
classification of images extracted from the Corel Stock Photo
Collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or
Gaussian RBF kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping
of the input $x_i rightarrow x_i^a$ improves the performance of
linear SVMs to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem,
a valid alternative to RBF kernels.},

	Abstract = {A family of kernels for statistical learning is
                 introduced that exploits the geometric structure of
                 statistical models. The kernels are based on the heat
                 equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the
                 Fisher information metric associated with a statistical
                 family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean
                 space. As an important special case, kernels based on
                 the geometry of multinomial families are derived,
                 leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply
                 naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers
                 and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved
                 using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on
                 Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are
                 presented for document classification, for which the
                 use of multinomial geometry is natural and well
                 motivated, and improvements are obtained over the
                 standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have
                 been the standard for text classification.},

    author = {Elie, Romuald and Espinosa, Gilles-Edouard},
    abstract = {{Considering a diffusion $X$ mean reverting to 0 {and starting at $X\_0>0$}, we study the control problem $$ \inf\_\theta \Esp{f\left(\frac{X\_\theta}{\Sup\_{s\in[0,\tau]}{X\_s}}\right)}\;,$$ where $f$ is a given function and $\tau$ is the next random time where the diffusion $X$ crosses zero. Our motivation is the obtention of optimal selling rules related to the minimization of the relative distance between a stopped mean reverting portfolio and its upcoming maximum. We provide a verification result for this stochastic control problem and derive the solution for different criteria $f$. For a power utility type criterion $f:y \mapsto - {y^\la}$ with $\la>0$, instantaneous stopping is always optimal. On the contrary, for a relative quadratic error criterion, $f:y \mapsto {(1-y)^2}$, selling is optimal as soon as the process $X$ crosses a specified function $\varphi$ of its running maximum $X^*$. As in [5] and [8], the inverse of $\varphi$ identifies as the maximal solution of a highly non linear ordinary differential equation. These results reinforce the idea that optimal prediction problems of similar type lead easily to solutions of different nature. Nevertheless, we observe numerically that the continuation region for the relative quadratic error criterion is very small, so that the optimal selling strategy is close to immediate stopping.}},
